Description: geomeTriD (Three Dimensional Geometry Package) 
  create interactive 3D plots using the GL library with the 'three.js' 
  visualization library (https://threejs.org) or the rgl library.
  In addition to creating interactive 3D plots, the application also generates 
  simplified models in 2D.
  These 2D models provide a more straightforward visual representation,
  making it easier to analyze and interpret the data quickly.
  This functionality ensures that users have access to both detailed 
  three-dimensional visualizations and more accessible two-dimensional views,
  catering to various analytical needs.
